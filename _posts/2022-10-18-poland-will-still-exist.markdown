title: Poland will still exist

(I'm intending to write short posts about concepts that I frequently use when thinking about AI futures. I reference these ideas in conversation often, but haven't written them down anywhere. This is the first one!)


I call this concept "Poland will still exist". I stumbled upon this idea in perhaps 2018 when I was talking with an acquaintance who's a transhumanist and expects an AGI singularity to happen. The conversation went a bit like this:

Her: "I expect an AGI singularity could happen in our lifetime. In the bad cases we'll get wiped out. In the good cases, it will be a transhumanist utopia. Humanity will have transcended disease, and people will probably be uploaded."

Me: "I'm not visualizing how we get from here to there. For concreteness, let's imagine a middle-aged woman in Poland. What will her life look like after the singularity?"

Her: "Well, I think things will have changed so radically and drastically after the singularity that Poland won't exist anymore."

When I heard this, I felt some frustration with this way of describing a good future. Polish people presumably care a lot about Poland, and want Poland to keep existing. 

(FWIW the reason "Poland" came to mind is I once looked it up as the country with the median *GDP per capita* - more on that in another post)

To state the obvious, it's not *impossible* for societal changes over a decade to be so large that almost all national identities that existed beforehand emerge unrecognizably changed. It's also not *impossible* for such societal change to be something that most people would voluntarily choose for themselves and their families.

Rather, it's that *something about* a change was bad if "Poland" isn't a thing anymore afterwards, even if all the formerly-Polish people are in the new "utopia" and got uploaded or whatever. Some *part* of the change was bad, even if other parts were good. If Poland doesn't exist anymore, then in that *specific way*, to that *specific extent*, something really quite bad has happened for the people-formerly-identified-as-Polish. Describing a "utopia" where this middle-aged woman still lives, but Poland as a cultural identity and geopolitical entity is gone, without some recognition that she would be unhappy about this, feels like a ["missing mood"](https://www.econlib.org/archives/2016/01/the_invisible_t.html)

In all likelihood, I would expect that if humanity undergoes a big technological-driven change over the course of a decade or less, and this change is *net good* for most people, then probably Poland still exists.

For me, keeping in mind a middle-aged Polish woman's experience, when imagining large-scale technological changes, helps me generate concrete futures with substantial *social continuity*; that is, continuity of people's group memberships and belonging-relevant affiliations.

I expect people's desires towards defending and maintaining their groups will pull humanity's trajectory towards worlds with considerable social continuity. And worlds where some other, more-disruptive force has overcome even these strongest bonds of affiliation is a world where something about the change was bad.
